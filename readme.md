# Finite automata Builders

Code written by [tado-mi](github.com/tado-mi).

Following is an implementation of a nondeterministic finite automaton (for now, without Îµ-transitions). It was written as a solution of an assignment for the course **CSC 173** at the University of Rochester. It is made public to demonstrate a code sample by the authors, and for learning. We trust it will not be used to violate academic honesty policies.

I intend to expand the code to **build** a nondeterministic finite automaton from a provided regular expression.
